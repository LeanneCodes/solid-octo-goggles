# Hello everyone reading #
## Hello again but in a smaller font size ##

I'm not entirely sure how to do equations in markdown, but I used to, so I'm gonna find some classic civil ones online
$$\sigma = \frac{M y}{I}$$
$$EI \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = M(x)$$
$$V_c = 0.79\, b_w\, d\, \sqrt{f_{ck}}$$

Sorry for any issues with the merging
